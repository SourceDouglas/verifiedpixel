  <h4>Izitru Tab</h4>
  <dl>
    <dt>Izitru verdict</dt>
      <dd>"The Verdict field contains Izitru's overall assessment of the image, corresponding to the verdicts displayed on the public-facing izitru website. These verdicts weigh the results of all six forensic tests performed on izitru. The verdict is encoded as an integer from 0 to 4, corresponding to the following descriptions. [Note: As currently configured, our automated tests will never return a value of 4.
This value is reserved for images that have undergone an expert review.]: 1. High Trust 2. Medium Trust 3. Undetermined File History 4. Potential File Modification 5. No Trust"</dd>
    <dt>Image quality</dt>
      <dd>A score given by Izitru to rank image quality, where 100 is best and 0 is worst. The image quality is assessed from a combination of blur, noise, and compression in the image. A user who is aware that you are using forensic techniques to detect original images may try to fool the system by modifying a photo and then taking a new photograph of a computer display or printout. Because this process tends to degrade image quality, the image quality metric can be a useful tool for flagging a photo of a photo</dd>
    <dt>JPEG structure</dt>
      <dd>The JPEG structure analysis examines the way in which the data in a JPEG file is packaged. This structure tends to be different for files saved from cameras compared to files saved from photo editing programs. If the image passes this test, the value of this field will be “Passed” A value of “Failed”</dd>
    <dt>Device signature analysis</dt>
      <dd>Indicates whether the image passed or failed Izitru's device signature analysis. The JPEG signature which includes compression settings and other details of how an image was saved tends to be distinct from one camera model to another, and changes significantly when a file is saved from software. If the JPEG signature on a file matches a signature known to come from the device that first captured the image, then it is highly likely that the file is an original, unmodified image. This positive test result is indicated when the value of the deviceSignatureAnalysis field is "Passed#. If the file did not pass this test, there are three possible values for this field. "Metadata missing# indicates that the file was lacking the EXIF metadata that specifies what camera was used to capture the image, so a signature analysis could not be done. "Unknown camera# indicates that the camera that was used to capture the image is not currently found in the izitru signature database, so a signature analysis could not be done. Finally, "Failed# indicates that the izitru signature database does contain signatures for this camera, but none of them were a match for the signature found on the image file.</dd>
    <dt>Sensor pattern analysis</dt>
      <dd>Sensor pattern analysis relies on the fact that files captured from a digital camera at that camera!s native resolution generally contain traces of the color filter array that sits over the image sensor. These traces begin to fade away as the file is subsequently edited. If the image passes this test, the value of this field will be “Passed”, indicating that the file is likely an original from a digital camera. Otherwise, the value will be “Failed”</dd>
    <dt>Multiple JPEG analysis</dt>
      <dd>This field combines the results of three different izitru tests - Double JPEG Detection, JPEG Ghost Detection, and JPEG Coefficient Analysis. Each of these tests represents a different technique for detecting that a file has been compressed as a JPEG more than once, which can be a clue that the file may have been edited. In addition, each of these tests is conducted in multiple runs, and the number of possible runs may vary based on such things as the quality of the image and the amount of detail an image contains. The multiple JPEG Analysis field contains two numbers in the form "[number of failed tests]/[total number of tests]. The second number represents the total number of test passes across all three tests, and the first number represents the number of those passes that failed. A healthy number of test runs is generally around 100 or more. If you see more than a handful of failed tests here, then that may be a strong indicator that the file is not an original. If no tests could be run, then this field will contain a value of "NA"</dd>
